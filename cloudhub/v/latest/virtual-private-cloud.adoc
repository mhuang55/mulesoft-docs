= Virtual Private Cloud
:keywords: cloudhub, vpc, ipsec, ssl, openvpn

CloudHub's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you ro create a virtually private and logically isolated network in the could to host your integration work loads.  You have the choice of using several connectivity methods that can connect your VPC securely and privately to your corporate intranet – whether on-premises or in other clouds – as if they were all part of a single, private network. 

== How VPC Works

The Virtual Private Cloud creates a logically private and isolated network to host your CloudHub worker instances. You will be able to define how this network will be configured and how it can connect to other networks for your integration needs. When your VPC is connected to your intranet using secure network connectivity methods you're effectively extending your corporate intranet into the cloud (see image below).

VPC can be connected to your corporate intranet or cloud infrastrcture using secure connectivity methods. You can leverage IPSec (Strongswan) or Amazon Web Services (AWS) Direct Connect to connect to remote networks. In the event that your remote network is also in AWS, VPC peering can be leverage given your CloudHub VPC and your AWS VPC are in the same region. Do note that to leverage AWS Direct Connect you must have the relationshiop with AWS to set up the direct connections. Once the direct connection is established it can be applied to your CloudHub VPC. Although there are serveral choices highlighted here, IPSec is in gernal the recommended solutions as it provides a secure and flexible way to connect your VPC to your on-prem networks.

== VPC Connectivity Methods

You can connect a Virtual Private Cloud to a datacenter using one of these methods:

. *Public Internet:* Default connectivity to CloudHub VPC.
. *IPsec tunnel with network-to-network configuration:* Connect a network to a CloudHub VPC with link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec[IPsec].
. *VPC Peering:* Connect an Amazon VPC directly to a CloudHub VPC.
. *AWS Direct Connect:* Connect a network to a CloudHub VPC using dedicated lines.

These two diagrams illustrate the IPsec network-to-network topologies:

== Configuring VPC for Your Account

The first step in setting up VPC for your account is to select the appropriate VPC connectiivty method for your use case. Then, contact your MuleSoft account representative to discuss your specific requirements. 

Once you have selected an option, download link:_attachments/VPC-Gateway-Questionnaire-v8.xlsm[the VPC discovery form] (requires at least MS Excel 2007 with macros enabled), then enter data to communicate the necessary details required for your topology. Once they receive your form and answer any remaining questions, the CloudHub support team securely exchanges keys and supplies instructions on how to configure your router(s).

The SLA for configuring VPC is 5 business days after link:_attachments/VPC-Gateway-Questionnaire-v8.xlsm[the VPC discovery form] has been completed and returned, though it may be completed sooner.

== Frequently Asked Questions about CloudHub VPC

*Can I reuse my existing Amazon VPC?*

No, but we can set up your CloudHub VPC to communicate with your existing Amazon VPC.

*How does VPC work with Amazon regions?*

Our VPC solution supports different Amazon regions. During setup, you need to specify which Amazon region you want. If you need support for multiple regions, please submit one copy of the discovery form for each region in which you need support. 

*Can I have multiple VPCs?*

Yes, customers can purchase as many VPCs as required, with a minimum purchase of two.  For more information on VPC pricing, contact your MuleSoft Account Executive.

*Can I have multiple VPCs in a single Amazon region?*

Yes, this is possible, but not included in our standard setup. Contact your account representative to discuss your requirements.

*How do I limit communication with my workers to my VPC channel?*

If you have VPC and you don't want your application exposed via the publicly accessible load balancer at `myapp.cloudhub.io`, you need to use 8091 or 8092 instead of `${http.port}` or `${https.port}`, respectively, when deploying your application.

*How do I communicate with my workers through my VPC without going over the public Internet?*

You can communicate with your Mule worker by using mule-worker-internal-myapp.cloudhub.io as the address in your configuration. This is a DNS A record which includes the IP addresses of all your workers.

*Can I assign an environment a VPC subnet?*

No. While VPCs can be shared across environments, you cannot control what subnet the environment deploys to.
