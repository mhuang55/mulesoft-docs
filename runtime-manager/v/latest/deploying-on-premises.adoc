You can use the Runtime Manager to deploy an application to a server that may be on premises.

* In order to do this, you must first link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers-on-premises#add-a-server[Add a Server] to your Runtime Manager.
* Then you can deploy apps to it, following the same steps as you would on link:/runtime-manager/deploying-an-application-to-runtime-manager[deploying an application].


[TIP]

When deploying to servers on premises, you don't need to provide the following information:

* Application Name
* Worker sizing settings
* Region
* Persistent Queues settings (not supported on premises)
* Properties (not supported on premises)
* Insights settings (not supported on premises)
* Logging settings (not supported on premises)
